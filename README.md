Quote
=====

A plugin for the [Err chatbot](https://github.com/gbin/err) that displays quotes in the chat.  Tested and developed for Slack, but I think it will work in any protocol

# Installing

# Usage

`!quote`
Will get a random quote for the quote file and send it to the chat

`!quote add <quote>;<attribute>`
Will add a quote to the quote file

# Contributing
